## 🤖 AI Chat System

Solrais features a **full AI chat system** powered by Groq API with access to real-time server data. Unlike basic chatbots, Solrais can actually **look up information** and **perform actions** using callable tools.

### How It Works

Mention Solrais or use the `s.` prefix to start chatting. The AI has:

- **🧠 Memory & Profile Learning** — Solrais remembers how you talk, your personality traits, interests, and writing style. The more you chat, the more personalized responses become.
- **🔧 12+ Callable Tools** — Instead of guessing, Solrais runs actual tools to fetch data:
  - Query user stats, sessions, and leaderboard positions
  - Search the knowledge base for Sol's RNG mechanics, auras, potions, and biomes
  - Look up server members and their macro activity
  - Find users by username with fuzzy/typo-tolerant matching
  - Generate images using the Magnific API
  - Analyze images sent in chat
- **🎯 Smart Context** — Understands follow-up questions, comparisons ("who has more hours, X or Y?"), and multi-turn conversations.
- **📸 Vision Support** — Send Solrais an image and it can analyze what's in it.
- **🛡️ Content Filtering** — Built-in safeguard pipeline checks responses for consistency and safety before posting.

### Example Things You Can Ask

> *"How many total hours does dxrkfire have?"*
> *"Compare my stats with n3ru's"*
> *"What's the rarest aura in Sol's RNG?"*
> *"Show me the leaderboard for this week"*
> *"Generate an image of a glitch biome"*
> *"What does this screenshot show?"*

## 🔧 Architecture

Solrais runs as a **distributed multi-node system**:

```
Discord ──► Relay Bot 1 ──► Main Bot ──► Dashboard
          ──► Relay Bot 2 ──► Main Bot ──► AI (Groq API)
          ──► Relay Bot 3 ──► Main Bot ──► Webhooks
          ──► Watchdog Handler (monitors everything)
```

- **Relay bots** (3 nodes) receive webhooks from macro clients and forward them
- **Main bot** processes sessions, relays, commands, and AI
- **Watchdog handler** keeps everything alive and alerts staff on failure
- **Web dashboard** provides live status and remote control
